## Finalised details

1. a game bot
2. for a simple game
3. using reinforcement learning                        



## Still need to decide:

1. platform (universe or muniverse)
2. which game


## Proposal

> We would like to create a AI game bot using OpenAI's platform Universe.
>
> Universe is a software platform that can be used for measuring and training the performance of AI programs across a diverse range of games, websites and other applications. Universe turns any program (such as a game) into an environment which can be used to train and test a bot, or a general AI agent. It does this by packaging the program into a Docker container, and presenting the AI with the same interface a human uses: sending keyboard and mouse events, and receiving screen pixels.
>
> Our bot would use reinforcement learning, because some environments in Universe such as a flash game for example, provide reward signals which can be used guide reinforcement learning. The bot shall be able to gradually learn from the reward signals it gets, and modify its behaviour to converge at a reasonably optimal strategy for playing the game.

## project (start now)

- description by next week
- implement project 
- data science vs knowledge engg project
  - either use a cluster (parallel/distributed) or a big data project using hadoop
