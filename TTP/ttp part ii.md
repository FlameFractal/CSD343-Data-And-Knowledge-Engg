### Problem Statement:

There is a thief who has to visit the given `n` cities in a car and pick up from total items  `m`. The distance between each city is given in distance matrix `d`. The items have an associated profit of `p_k` and each item has weight `w_k`. The maximum carrying capacity of the car is `W`. Thief cannot visit a city more than once. Find out the path that the thief should take in order to maximise his profit and minimise the time taken to reach back to the original city.

- Total distance 
  $$
  D = \sum _{i=0,j=0}^{n,n} \pi(i,j) * d_{i,j}
  $$

- Total Profit
  $$
  P = \sum _{i=0}^{n} \theta(i) * d_{i} 
  $$

- Total Time  

  i = `city travelling from `

  j =`city travelling to`
  $$
  T = \pi(i,j) * ( \sum_{i=0,j=0}^{n,n} d(i,j)/v + \sum \theta(k)*t(k) )
  $$

- Weight 

  â€‹
  $$
  \sum w_k <= W 
  $$


### Assumptions:

- Can pick same item from multiple cities
- Cannot visit a city more than once
- If knapsack is full, may come back to origin city
